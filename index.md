## Welcome to CNY Community Data

CNYCF is devoted to cultivating a culture of data sharing and data-driven decision-making among social sector organizations throughout the Central NY region.

### Meeting Times & Locations

Community Data meets biweekly, alternating with CNYCF's R Learning Community, providing local Social Sector professionals a venue to learn from one another, share data and ideas, and hone their data science acumen for the betterment of communities in Central New York. Both take place on Fridays, from 8:30 - 9:30 AM EST, at the Central New York Philanthropy Center.

### Community Data Meetings

Community Data Meetings focus on all things data-driven projects, presentations, and discussions on local matters at the city, county, and regional level. Each meeting is facilitated using a series of agenda items and are designed to cultivate a spirit and culture of data sharing in the region.

### R Learning Community

The R Learning Community focuses on the fundamentals of R programming, RStudio, and data science. Each session, a facilitator leads learners along a shared script introducing new functions, packages, and datasets, which focus on data cleaning and tidying, manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Sessions end with a series of challenges for individual, paired, and small group practice.

Each new session tends to builds on previous ones, but these meetups are designed to be intuitive, immersive, and paced for learners with little to no programming or data science experience. Local and regional data are often used, while learning objectives are geared towards the Public and Nonprofit Sectors.

* Attendees should arrive with both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.4.2/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) downloaded and installed prior to each meeting.
